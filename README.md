# Simple Task List
This is a hobby project built in python to test out my ability to make a simple "todo list" program.

You can execute the CLI by typing in `simpletodo` in a terminal of your choice

# Targets
1. Build a fully functional CLI
2. Build a GUI around the existing code
3. Become stable

# Installation

## Windows
### You may need to allow running scripts from the web

1. Open Terminal (Admin)
2. Paste in the command below

`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

#### One-liner
`iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Harley-PY/SimpleTaskList/main/install-script/install.ps1 | iex`

## MacOS and linux

#### One-liner
`bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Harley-PY/SimpleTaskList/main/install-scripts/install.sh)`
